# Genie-BigQuery

This resource is only available for AACR GENIE consortium members only!

This repository will contain the BigQuery scripts that are used to analyze the GENIE data.  Please view the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to add to this repository.

## Usage

Google's permission model allows for those that have BigQuery User access to a BigQuery project to query all publically available data.  We are utilizing the 1TB free query resource every month to provide this free as a free resource to GENIE consortium members.  Due to this, please restrict all queries to the tables within the GENIE BigQuery project.  We have not found a way to limit the queries that members can do to only within a specific project.  If you want to query a publically available resource, please use a different billing code.
